# `GetUserInfo( psycore8 )`

Hey, nice to see you here. My name is **Sascha** aka **psycore8** and here you are on my github profile. IT is my passion and has fascinated me since I was a child. I love getting to the bottom of things, analyzing and understanding them. This is how my path led me into IT security. As an IT security officer, I ensure that IT security is increased and maintained.

Programming has accompanied me from the very beginning. I started with my first attempts in `C++`, then switched to `Object Pascal`, which I worked with for many years. After a several-year break, I found a new entry point with `Python`, which has been especially useful in IT security.

Developing offensive tools helps me better understand attack vectors. Only when a security vulnerability is understood on a technical level is it possible to close it effectively.
