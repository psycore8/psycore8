# `GetUserInfo( psycore8 )`

Hi there! My name is Sascha aka **psycore8**. I‚Äôm an Information Security Officer with a passion for everything IT ‚Äî from code to cyber defense.
Programming in Python isn't just a skill, it's part of how I think and solve problems. Whether I'm building tools, automating workflows, or exploring security mechanisms, Python is often my weapon of choice.

üîê I‚Äôm a certified penetration tester with hands-on experience in identifying, exploiting, and mitigating vulnerabilities ‚Äî always with the goal of making systems more secure and resilient.

üõ°Ô∏è In my current role, I help shape and enforce security strategies to protect organizations from emerging threats, while staying deeply connected to the technical roots of cybersecurity.

üìÅ On this GitHub, you‚Äôll find a mix of personal projects, security tools, and research ‚Äî all reflecting my drive to learn, build, and contribute to the InfoSec community.

Let‚Äôs connect, collaborate, and secure the future ‚Äî one line of code at a time.
